        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "Ans-> Object oriented programming, a way of writing programme.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "Ans-> Class is a blueprint of creating an object\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "Ans-> An object is an instance of a class that contains, Actual Product made from the blueprint class\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "Ans-> Abstraction hides implementation details, Reduce complexity were Encapsulation hides data, Increase security\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "Ans-> Dunder methods are special built-in methods in Python that start and end with two underscores, Python uses them to implement operator overloading, object behavior, and customization.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP?\n",
        "Ans-> Inheritance in OOP is a mechanism that allows a class to use the properties and methods of another class.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "Ans-> The same function or operator can behave differently depending on the     object or data type.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "Ans-> Encapsulation in Python is achieved by:\n",
        "     1.Public attributes/methods → accessible anywhere.\n",
        "     2.Protected attributes (_var) → conventionally for internal use.\n",
        "     3.Private attributes (__var) → enforced by name mangling.\n",
        "     4.Getter & Setter methods → control how private data is accessed/modified.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "Ans-> In Python, a constructor is a special method used to initialize objects when a class is created. It is automatically called when you create a new instance of a class\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "Ans-> Class Methods - Defined using the @classmethod decorator.The first parameter is cls, which refers to the class itself.They can access or modify class-level variables.\n",
        "Static Methods - Defined using the @staticmethod decorator.They don’t take self or cls as the first argument.They cannot modify object state or class state.They behave like normal functions but live inside the class for organization/logical grouping.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "Ans-> Method overloading in Python refers to the concept where a single function or method can exhibit different behaviors based on the number or type of arguments passed to it.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "Ans-> Method overriding occurs when a child class defines a method with the same name, same parameters, and same return type as a method in its parent class.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "Ans-> The property decorator in Python is used to turn a method into a property.\n",
        "It lets you define getter, setter, and deleter methods in a clean, Pythonic way — without explicitly calling methods like get_name() or set_name().\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "Ans-> Polymorphism means the same operation or method can behave differently depending on the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "Ans-> An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and is meant to be a blueprint for other classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "Ans-> 1. Modularity,Code is divided into classes and objects, making it easier\n",
        "         to organize.Each class has a clear role → improves readability and maintenance.\n",
        "         2.Reusability,Once a class is written, it can be reused across projects.Inheritance allows new classes to be built on top of existing ones without rewriting code.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "Ans-> Class variable is variable shared by all objects of a class. Stored at the class level\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python\n",
        "Ans-> Multiple inheritance means a class can inherit from more than one parent class. In other words, a child class can access attributes and methods from multiple base classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of ‘’__str__’ and ‘__repr__’ ‘ methods in Python?\n",
        "Ans-> __str__\n",
        "Called by the str() function and print().\n",
        "Provide a human-readable string representation of the object (user-friendly).\n",
        "__repr__(self)\n",
        "Called by the repr() function, or when you just type the object in an interactive shell.\n",
        "Provide an unambiguous representation of the object (developer-oriented).\n",
        "Ideally, it should be a string that could be used to recreate the object\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the ‘super()’ function in Python?\n",
        "Ans-> The significance of the 'super()' fuction\n",
        "      Access Parent Methods Easily\n",
        "      Instead of writing ParentClass.method(self, ...), you just use super().method(...). Supports Multiple Inheritance\n",
        "      Works with Method Resolution Order (MRO) to decide which parent’s method to call.Prevents calling the wrong parent in complex inheritance.Avoids Code Duplication\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "Ans-> Helps in releasing resources automatically. But not always reliable in timing, so Python recommends using context managers instead for resource management.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "Ans-> Use @staticmethod when the method is independent of class/instance.\n",
        "      Use @classmethod when the method needs to work with class-level data.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "ans-> Polymorphism with inheritance allows subclasses to override methods from the parent. This lets different objects respond to the same method call in different ways. Makes code flexible and extensible — you can add new classes without changing existing code.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "Ans-> Method chaining in Python OOP means calling multiple methods on the same object in a single line by making each method return the object itself (self).\n",
        "\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "Ans-> The __call__ method allows an instance of a class to be called like a function.\n",
        "If a class defines __call__, you can do obj() and it will execute the logic inside __call__.\n",
